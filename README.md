# Icentivizing Orphan Drug Development

## A regulatory impact analysis on orphan drug provision in the U.S and EU


Hello and welcome,
The project was conducted as part of a Health Economics academic research assignment and focuses on the effectiveness and evolution of policy incentives aimed at encouraging pharmaceutical innovation for rare disease diagnosis and treatment.
In collaboration with dear colleague Jonathan Palm, supervised by Dr. Christian Feilcke at Department of Ecocnomics.


### Project Overview
Orphan drugs are essential for addressing rare diseases but often face economic challenges due to small patient populations. To promote development, both the US and EU offer regulatory incentives across different stages of the drug R&D lifecycle.

This project analyzes:
**Incentives overview**: A structured mapping of key incentives applied along the drug development process (from laboratory research to marketing authorization)
**Policy effectiveness**: An assessment of how well these incentives translate into actual drug availability, efficacy, fair pricing, and patient access
**Policy design & evolution**: Critical discussion on whether incentives are utilized, equitably applied and how policy frameworks are evolving over time


### Deliverables
**Slide Deck: Overview of incentives along the drug R&D process and regional comparison U.S. vs. EU**

    1. Lists all incentives (potentially) applied along the pharmasceutical drug development journey, from laboratory to marketing authorization.
    2. Provides a structured comparison between the U.S. and EU incentive frameworks.

**Written report: Impact of key policies on patient welfare**

    3. Argues the economic reasoning of incentivizing orphan drug development.
    4. Analyzes policy design choices and how they effect patient welfare, in the form of drug availability, efficacy, pricing, and access.
    5. Discusses policy evoluation.


### Methodology
This study is a qualitative, literature-based analysis. It synthesizes information from:
    Academic papers
    Regulatory reports (FDA, EMA, WHO, ...)
    Industry publications
    News articles
    Government and NGO resources
No original data modeling was conducted. The focus was on structured synthesis and critical evaluation of existing sources.


### Note
This is a qualitative policy research project, focusing on incentive structures and health impact assessment, rather than empirical data modeling.
