### A regulatory impact analysis
### on orphan drug provision in the U.S and EU

Hello and welcome,
This work was conducted in collaboration with dear colleague Jonathan Palm as part of an academic research project.

## Project files
**Overview of incentives along the drug R&D process and regional comparison (slide deck)**
    1. Lists all incentives (potentially) applied along the pharmasceutical drug development journey, from laboratory to marketing authorization.
    2. Provides a structured comparison between the U.S. and EU incentive frameworks.

**Impact of key policies on patient welfare (written report)**
    3. Argues the economic reasoning of incentivizing orphan drug development.
    4. Analyzes policy design choices and how they effect patient welfare, in the form of drug availability, efficacy, pricing, and access.
    5. Discusses policy evoluation.

## Methodology
This project is a synthesis of academic literature, policy reports, and industry data. While it does not involve original data analysis, it applies structured reasoning to assess the effectiveness of existing regulatory mechanisms.

### Note
This is a qualitative policy research project, focusing on incentive structures and welfare outcomes, rather than empirical data modeling.

Thank you.
